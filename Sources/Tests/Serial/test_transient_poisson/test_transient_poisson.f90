!> The program of the *Test Transient Poisson* docummented [here](../page/tests/test_transient_poisson.html)
!> which validates the *time stepping*

!* The `[[test_transient_poisson]]`,
program test_transient_poisson
!* uses the `fempar_names` and `test_transient_poisson_driver_names`:
  use fempar_names
  use test_transient_poisson_driver_names
  !* First, declare the `test_driver` and the `world_contest`  
  implicit none
  type(test_transient_poisson_driver_t) :: test_driver
  type(serial_context_t)      :: world_context
  !* Then, initialite
  call world_context%create()
  call fempar_init()
  !* and, setup according to the input parameters
  call test_driver%parse_command_line_parameters()
  call test_driver%setup_environment(world_context)
  !* Perform the core computations of the test, placed into [`run_simulation`](#run-simulation)
  call test_driver%run_simulation()
  !* Finally, free and finalize the used variables: 
  call test_driver%free_environment()
  call fempar_finalize()
  call world_context%free(finalize=.true.)
end program test_transient_poisson

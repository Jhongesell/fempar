  !This operator is the global RK operator as follows.
  !In RK methods, for a s-stage method, given u_0, we must compute
  ![ v_1, v_s ] st
  !v_1 + A ( t + c_1 dt , v_0 + a_11 v_1 ) = 0
  !...
  !v_i + A ( t + c_i dt, v_0 + \sum_{j=1}^s a_ij v_j ) = 0
  !...
  !to finally get
  !u_1 =  u_0 + \sum_{i=1}^s b_i v_i = 0.
  ! As a result, the RK problem can be stated in compact form as R(U)=0, where
  ! U = [v_1, ..., v_s]. The objective is to solve this problem and 
  ! extract u_1 = u_0 + \sum_{i=1}^s b_i v_i = 0.
  ! One must compute, given U, its application R(U). So, I want a apply method that, 
  ! given the stage i I want to get, it applies the i-stage R_i(U) application.
  ! However, in DIRK RK methods, the ones usually used, the coupling is weaker, and 
  ! should exploit it. R_i(U) only depends on v_j, for j \leq i.
  ! In this case, we want to solve at every stage
  ! R_i( v_0, ..., v_i ) = 0, where v_0, ..., v_i-1 are known, which we can denote as
  ! R*_i(v_i) = 0.
  ! In order to solve this potential nonlinear operator, we must provide its tangent too.
  ! We need the nonlinear operator: Given i, and v_1, ..., v_i-1, v_i+1,...,v_s, 
  ! R_ij(V) = R_i (v_1, ...,v_i-1,V,v_i+1,...,v_s).
  ! Next, I compute the apply and tangent of this operator, which is all I need to apply
  ! the whole operator.

  ! sbadia: I must provide a method to get the solution
  ! u_1 =  u_0 + \sum_{i=1}^s b_i v_i = 0.

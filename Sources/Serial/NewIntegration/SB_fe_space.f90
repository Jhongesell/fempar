  ! This module includes the physical FE and FE space structure. It includes the
  ! following types:
  !
  ! * finite_element_t: It includes pointers to the unknown/geometrical reference_fe_t
  !   and the corresponding volume integrator, the local-to-global mapping for DOFs in
  !   elem2dof and the boundary conditions restricted to the element
  ! * fe_space_t: The abstract fe_space_t, which only includes some deferred methods 
  !   that must be provided by any fe_space_t concretization
  ! * serial_fe_space_t: The serial version of the fe_space_t, which includes an array
  !   of finite_element_t, the array of all possible reference_fe_t and volume_integrator_t
  !   in the FE space, the total number of DOFs and an array that provides the DOFs
  !   in a VEF.

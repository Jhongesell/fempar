! Templated implementation of a hash table based element set, extension of 
! the abstract element_set defined in element_set.i90. The code is similar 
! but has some differences with respect to standard hash_tables used elsewhere
! in FEMPAR. An iterator over the table is also defined.
! 
! Templates are not natively supported by fortran.
! They are emulated using the preprocessor by including this file in a module 
! BEFORE the contains statement and after a definition of:
!
! template_element_t
! hash_template_element_set_t
! hash_template_element_iterator_t
!
! This code also requires the use of the module element_id_names which define
! the element_id_t class hierarchy.
